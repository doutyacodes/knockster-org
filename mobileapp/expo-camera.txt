Expo Camera iconExpo Camera
A React component that renders a preview for the device's front or back camera.


Ask AI




Bundled version:
~17.0.10

Copy page

expo-camera provides a React component that renders a preview of the device's front or back camera. The camera's parameters such as zoom, torch, and flash mode are adjustable. Using CameraView, you can take photos and record videos that are saved to the app's cache. The component is also capable of detecting bar codes appearing in the preview. Run the example on your device to see all these features working together.

Installation
Terminal

Copy

npx expo install expo-camera
If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, make sure to install expo in your project.

Configuration in app config
You can configure expo-camera using its built-in config plugin if you use config plugins in your project (Continuous Native Generation (CNG)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

Example app.json with config plugin
app.json

Copy


{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-camera",
        {
          "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera",
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone",
          "recordAudioAndroid": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
Configurable properties
Name	Default	Description
cameraPermission	"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera"	
Only for: 

A string to set the NSCameraUsageDescription permission message.

microphonePermission	"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"	
Only for: 

A string to set the NSMicrophoneUsageDescription permission message.

recordAudioAndroid	true	
Only for: 

A boolean that determines whether to enable the RECORD_AUDIO permission on Android.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?






Usage
Only one Camera preview can be active at any given time. If you have multiple screens in your app, you should unmount Camera components whenever a screen is unfocused.

Advanced usage
Camera app example
A complete example that shows how to take a picture and display it. Written in TypeScript.

Web support
Most browsers support a version of web camera functionality, you can check out the web camera browser support here. Image URIs are always returned as base64 strings because local file system paths are unavailable in the browser.

Chrome iframe usage
When using Chrome versions 64+, if you try to use a web camera in a cross-origin iframe nothing will render. To add support for cameras in your iframe simply add the attribute allow="microphone; camera;" to the iframe element:

<iframe src="..." allow="microphone; camera;">
  <!-- <CameraView /> -->
</iframe>

Parameter	Type	Description
options
(optional)
CameraRecordingOptions	
A map of CameraRecordingOptions type.


Starts recording a video that will be saved to cache directory. Videos are rotated to match device's orientation. Flipping camera during a recording results in stopping it.

Returns:
Promise<undefined | { uri: string }>
Returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing video file uri property and a codec property on iOS. The Promise is returned if stopRecording was invoked, one of maxDuration and maxFileSize is reached or camera preview is stopped.

takePictureAsync(optionsWithRef)
Overload #1
Parameter	Type	Description
optionsWithRef	
CameraPictureOptions & {
  pictureRef: true
}
An object in form of CameraPictureOptions type and pictureRef key set to true.


Takes a picture and returns an object that references the native image instance.

Note: Make sure to wait for the onCameraReady callback before calling this method.

Note: Avoid calling this method while the preview is paused. On Android, this will throw an error. On iOS, this will take a picture of the last frame that is currently on screen.

Returns:
Promise<PictureRef>
Returns a Promise that resolves to PictureRef class which contains basic image data, and a reference to native image instance which can be passed to other Expo packages supporting handling such an instance.

takePictureAsync(options)
Overload #2
Parameter	Type	Description
options
(optional)
CameraPictureOptions	
An object in form of CameraPictureOptions type.


Takes a picture and saves it to app's cache directory. Photos are rotated to match device's orientation (if options.skipProcessing flag is not enabled) and scaled to match the preview.

Note: Make sure to wait for the onCameraReady callback before calling this method.

Note: Avoid calling this method while the preview is paused. On Android, this will throw an error. On iOS, this will take a picture of the last frame that is currently on screen.

Returns:
Promise<CameraCapturedPicture>
Returns a Promise that resolves to CameraCapturedPicture object, where uri is a URI to the local image file on Android, iOS, and a base64 string on web (usable as the source for an Image element). The width and height properties specify the dimensions of the image.

base64 is included if the base64 option was truthy, and is a string containing the JPEG data of the image in Base64. Prepend it with 'data:image/jpg;base64,' to get a data URI, which you can use as the source for an Image element for example.

exif is included if the exif option was truthy, and is an object containing EXIF data for the image. The names of its properties are EXIF tags and their values are the values for those tags.

On native platforms, the local image URI is temporary. Use FileSystem.copy to make a permanent copy of the image.

toggleRecordingAsync()
Pauses or resumes the video recording. Only has an effect if there is an active recording. On iOS, this method only supported on iOS 18.

Returns:
Promise<undefined | void>
Example

const { toggleRecordingAsyncAvailable } = getSupportedFeatures()

return (
 {toggleRecordingAsyncAvailable && (
   <Button title="Toggle Recording" onPress={toggleRecordingAsync} />
 )}
)
Hooks

(optional)
boolean	
Only for: 

-
mirror
(optional)
boolean	
Deprecated Use mirror prop on CameraView instead.

When set to true, the output image will be flipped along the vertical axis when using the front camera.

Default:
false
onPictureSaved
(optional)
(picture: CameraCapturedPicture) => void	
A callback invoked when picture is saved. If set, the promise of this method will resolve immediately with no data after picture is captured. The data that it should contain will be passed to this callback. If displaying or processing a captured photo right after taking it is not your case, this callback lets you skip waiting for it to be saved.

pictureRef
(optional)
boolean	
Whether the camera should return an image ref that can be used directly in the Image component.

(optional)
number	
Specify the compression quality from 0 to 1. 0 means compress for small size, and 1 means compress for maximum quality.

(optional)
number	
Only for: 

-
shutterSound

Default:
true
skipProcessing
(optional)
boolean	
If set to true, camera skips orientation adjustment and returns an image straight from the device's camera. If enabled, quality option is discarded (processing pipeline is skipped as a whole). Although enabling this option reduces image delivery time significantly, it may cause the image to appear in a wrong orientation in the Image component (at the time of writing, it does not respect EXIF orientation of the images).

Note: Enabling skipProcessing would cause orientation uncertainty. Image component does not respect EXIF stored orientation information, that means obtained image would be displayed wrongly (rotated by 90°, 180° or 270°). Different devices provide different orientations. For example some Sony Xperia or Samsung devices don't provide correctly oriented images by default. To always obtain correctly oriented image disable skipProcessing option.
